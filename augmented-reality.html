                    <p class="description">I create Augmented Reality (AR) experiences because I see it as compelling
                        tool for self-expression on the internet, like a virtual form of fashion. I like to
                        experiment with different styles and interactions, with effects ranging from applying on the
                        face alone to the entire body. I like the versatility of AR; I can allow the viewer to
                        exaggerate
                        a certain emotion, try experimental or physically impossible makeup effects, or virtually
                        cosplay the
                        role of a fictional character. I love seeing people use my
                        effects in unexpected ways. I see interactive media as a conversation between me and the viewer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">Inclusivity is important to me when creating AR effects. The key is providing
                        options. Some people wear makeup and others prefer not to, so I aim to provide the option for
                        any
                        effect with many layered components. Multiple colorways for the makeup allows viewers to
                        choose one that best suits their preference or skin color as well. I avoid incorporating face
                        deformation effects that mimic plastic surgery, such as subtle alterations to the nose or
                        cheekbones, because I don't subscribe to the idea of an ideal face shape. </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The original inspiration for this piece stems from long-exposure film photography. Particularly
                        the "law of reciprocity" between aperture and shutter speed. This law fails when using shutter
                        speeds longer than a certain threshold. The threshold is unique to each film stock's chemical
                        properties. This phenomenon is called Reciprocity Failure. The ghostly or blurred effects of
                        capturing motion at slow shutter speeds inspire the trail effect shown in this Augmented Reality
                        (AR) effect.</p>

                    <p>AR is an ideal medium to explore themes of embodiment and self-representation. In real
                        relationships, "chemistry" does not always work in our favor. This piece aims to immerse the
                        viewer in the emotion of experiencing unreciprocated feelings in a relationship, through the
                        bleak color palette and the depiction of a fading essence from the human form. Simultaneously,
                        it encourages a playful engagement from the viewer toward such sentiments by moving their bodies
                        and engaging physically with the piece.

                    </div>
                    <p>
                        This piece is an investigation into post-digital beauty rituals. By reimagining makeup as
                        temporal, animated, and linguistically embedded. </p>

                    <p><em>No Tears</em> started out as an experiment in integrating Typography with face filters. It
                        needed
                        to be a vertically written language to mimic flowing tears. I got the help of a
                        Japanese friend to finalize the type. The Japanese words roughly translate
                        to "no tears" and "no sadness", repeated.
                    </p>

                    <p>I noticed that AR beauty filters featuring crying or tear effects had become a genre of their own
                        in terms of popularity. The romanticization of sadness and emotional vulnerability is already
                        pervasive throughout media and pop culture. The piece highlights the tension
                        between visual expression and implicit meaning, where tears flow as typography while the words
                        themselves reject emotional display, questioning our pursuit of aestheticized vulnerability as a
                        form of digital beauty enhancement.

                        eyes.</p>

                            The protagonist's distinct aesthetic inspired the makeup elements surrounding the typography.
